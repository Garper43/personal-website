                Mapper is aimed to solve the problem of mapping stuff in video-games. It allows the user to upload an image and then draw on top of it and place markers to mark collectibles and whatnot.

                Everything the user draws is vector graphics that can be edited live.

                <b>Ways I've used it myself</b>
                I've previously used it to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep track of my stashes in DayZ</li>
                <li>Make a map for multiple school projects</li>
                <li>Take notes with a stylus. The fact that you have an infinite canvas and you can dynamically change strokes you've already made makes it good for note-taking</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                But there are many other possible uses for this tool.
            </p>
