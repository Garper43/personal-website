                //I'm a fresh high school graduate who likes making things work
                //I don't have a college degree yet but I did take a decent amount of classes at Edmonds Community College while I was still in hs
                //And I hope to continue my education and get a degree once I make some more money to pay for it

                <b>//My Projects</b>
                <a href="./projects/chessgame/index.html" >Chess-Game</a>
                //A chess game with java on the back-end and a web based front-end
                //It also has a cool "8-bit" theme

                <a href="./projects/mapper/index.html" >Mapper</a>
                //A tool for making maps
                //It's currently on pause because I've switched to working on the chess-game because it's more back-end and logic heavy (which is how I like it)

                <a href="" >Map making tool for Acid-Trip</a>
                //A fork of Mapper that's means to build levels for my classmate's game
                //The game doesn't actually read half the stuff you can do in the builder but oh well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

                //These are the two of my "capstone" projects
                //I've made many more things like discord bots and minecraft plugins but they're not as exciting
